# car_parking_project

##Detailed description of system:

System is required to display the available parking slots on an LCD out of the total slots. As per the requirements two IR sensors have been set up at the entry and exit gate of the parking. An LCD has been initialized to zero count when the parking is empty. The sensor at the entry gate increments the counter when the car enters the parking, the other sensor at the exit gate decrements the counter when the car leaves the parking. This gives the user an idea whether parking is available or not.

System is now required to display which parking slots are empty if the parking is available. Suppose the parking area has 8 slots of parking and if any slot is empty the LCD displays the slot number which is empty else it displays that the parking is full.

It is most important to monitor and secure car parking area. Thatâ€™s why here we are monitoring and storing data with time and date.
Here we are using camera to capture image data and Matlab pc software to process it and storing it in pc or laptop.

More details on implementation can be found in the project 1.pdf file
